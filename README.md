🌐 Localization in Selenium Automation

One of the key advantages of automation testing is its ability to seamlessly test applications in multiple languages. Let's explore how we can implement localization in Selenium with Java in just a few steps:

1️⃣ Prepare Localization Files:

Create JSON files containing localized vocabulary for different languages.

Example:search_Ar.json: {"searchWord": "اللغه العربيه"}

search_EN.json: {"searchword": "English"}

search_DE.json: {"searchWord": "Arabische Sprache"}

2️⃣ Create a JSON Data Reader Class:

Develop a class to read JSON files and extract the search keyword based on the specified language.

3️⃣ Implement Test Case:

Write a test case class to utilize the JSON data reader and interact with the search feature using the localized search keyword.

4️⃣ Run Test Case:

Specify the desired language when running the test case to determine which JSON file to use for localization.

By following these steps, we can efficiently test the search feature across different languages using Selenium automation.
